\subsection*{Project Progress Report: W3500 Independent Biological Research}
\subsubsection*{Kyelee Ruth Fitts}

The goal of the project is, succinctly, to find and quantify the
statistical bias of tests for polygenic adaptation that has to do
with allele frequency being correlated with allele
dominance. Specifically, we want to investigate the effect that
directional dominance has on the statistic, $Q_x$, used to determine
whether alleles have a significant effect on a polygenic trait. $Q_x$
can be expressed in terms of the effect size $\alpha$ in this
relationship \cite{gwasintro}:

\begin{equation} \label{eqn:Qxraw}
  Q_X = \frac{1}{V_A F_{ST}} \sum_{m=1}^M \sum_{\ell=1}^L \sum_{\ell\prime=1}^L \alpha_{\ell} \alpha_{\ell^{\prime}}\left(p_{m\ell} - \overline{p}_\ell \right)\left(p_{m \ell\prime} - \overline{p}_{\ell\prime}\right)
\end{equation}

Where $\alpha$ can be represented in terms of the dominance deviation
$D_l$ (the effect size shift due to dominance)  at each locus $l$ and
the homozygous effect (effect size shift due to homozygosity or heterozygosity) $A_l$ at each
locus:

\begin{equation}  \label{eqn:avgeff}
  \alpha_\ell = \frac{1}{2} A_\ell + D_\ell\left(1-2p_{1\ell}\right).
\end{equation}

Substituting \eqref{eqn:avgeff} into \eqref{eqn:Qxraw}, we can
algebraically derive the following expansion:

\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
  \sum^L_{l=1}( \frac{1}{2}A_l(p_{1l}-\epsilon_l))^2+\sum^L_{l=1}\sum^L_{
    l \neq l'}(\frac{1}{4}A_l(p_{1l}-\epsilon_{l})A_{l'}(p_{1l'}-\epsilon_{l'}))
  \\
  +\sum^L_{l=1}A_lD_l(1-2p_{1l})(p_{1l}-\epsilon_l)^2 +
  \sum^L_{l=1}\sum^L_{l \neq
    l'}(\frac{1}{2}A_lD_{l'}(1-2_{p1l'})(p_{1l}-\epsilon_l)(p_{1l'}-\epsilon_{l'}) \\
  + \frac{1}{2}D_lA_{l'}(1-2_{p1l})(p_{1l}-\epsilon_l)(p_{1l'}-\epsilon_{l'})) \\
   + \sum^L_{l=1} (D_l(1-2p_l)(p_{1l}-\epsilon_{1}))^2
   + \sum^L_{l=1}\sum^L_{l \neq
     l'}D_{l}(1-2p_{l})(p_{1l}-\epsilon_{1})D_{l'}(1-2p_{l'})(p_{1l'}-\epsilon_{l'}) \label{second_exp_ult}
  \end{split}
\end{equation}

Where we can expect much of the bias in the $Qx$ statistic coming from
dominance to come from the last two terms involving $D_l$. Since the
semester has begun, I've been creating simulations to verify the
effect that dominance has on the test statistic. On the second page,
Figure 1 shows the distribution of the $Q_x$ statistic without dominance as simulated by
the expansion above, which matches a chi-squared distribution with
degree of freedom equal to 1, as expected.

Figures 2, 3, and 4 compare the expected cumulative distribution
function of the $Q_x$ statistic (in red) with the cdf of the simulated
distribution. When the dominance deviation is zero, as expected the
two are nearly identical. However, as dominance deviation increases,
the distribution of the $Q_x$ statistic shifts further and further to
the right. This is further shown in figure 5, which plots the fraction
of the simulated statistics above the value of the statistic expected
for 5\% of the expected distribution, which is chi-squared with 1
df. That is, the plot shows the proportion of $Q_x$ values above the p = 0.05 cutoff value
of the expected chi-squared distribution for different dominance
deviation values. As expected, this plot also
shows that the proportion of simulated $Q_x$ values over the expected
threshold increases as the effect of dominance increases.

Finally, figures 6, 7, and 8 show how dominance affects the genetic
value (that is, the change in allele frequency multiplied by the effect size $\alpha$)
over time. These figures are especially interesting because they show
how specifically directional dominance can affect genetic value. When the
dominance deviation is equal to 0 in figure 6, as expected the genetic
values of the replicates drift randomly over time and the mean line
(red) is approximately zero. However, for very positive dominance
deviations (fig. 7), the genetic value over time becomes negative, while for
very negative dominance deviations, the genetic value over time
becomes positive. This indicates that the bias due to dominance will
increase the perceived effect size and result in false positives if alleles tend to be recessive 
(as with height) and decrease the perceived effect size for alleles
displaying dominance.

So far the work I've been doing this semester has been mainly in
assembling these simulations to directly quantify the statistical bias
in these tests due to dominance. I am currently working on a simulation that will break
down the terms of the expansion to see what effect each term has
separately on the distribution of the statistic. In addition, I have just gained access to the
UK BioBank data and will be searching for the bias using that data as
soon as I receive the proper training to use the data.
