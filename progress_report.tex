The (chi-squared distributed) test statistic $Q_x$ is used in
population genetics to determine whether a polygenic trait shows
signals of selection across different populations, given the effect
sizes (determined by genome-wide association studies, or GWAS) and frequencies of each locus that
contributes to the trait. We expect populations that have drifted
apart to have no selection under the null model, but if $Q_x$ is
significant, then we know that the genetic value (weighted average of
change in allele frequencies from the ancestral frequency multiplied by the
effect size) is different among the different populations is not due to random processes like drift. 

Below is the expression for the statistic in terms of the average
effect size $\alpha$ over each locus, the ancestral allele frequency
$\overline{p}$, and the current allele frequency $p$ of our target
population, with each parameter taken over loci $l$ and $l'$. \cite{gwasintro}

\begin{equation} \label{eqn:Qxraw}
  Q_X = \frac{1}{V_A F_{ST}} \sum_{m=1}^M \sum_{\ell=1}^L \sum_{\ell\prime=1}^L \alpha_{\ell} \alpha_{\ell^{\prime}}\left(p_{m\ell} - \overline{p}_\ell \right)\left(p_{m \ell\prime} - \overline{p}_{\ell\prime}\right)
\end{equation}

The average effect size at each locus is of particular
importance-- not only does GWAS use it to determine which alleles are deemed
significant to a trait, but it is also the weighting factor for loci in the
expression for $Q_x$. The average effect size depends on the allele
frequency, the homozygous effect size (effect size of the most frequent homozygote) and the
dominance deviation (difference in effect size for the heterozygote
deviating from $\frac{1}{2}$ of the homozygous effect size). Below is the expression for $\alpha$,
represented in terms of the dominance deviation $D_l$ at each locus and
the homozygous effect $A_l$ at each locus:

\begin{equation}  \label{eqn:avgeff}
  \alpha_\ell = \frac{1}{2} A_\ell + D_\ell\left(1-2p_{1\ell}\right).
\end{equation}

The use of $\alpha$ in this statistic becomes problematic in the
presence of directional dominance, which is when alleles for a
particular trait with a positive effect size are systematically
dominant or when alleles with a negative effect size are
systematically recessive. Quantitatively, this means the signs of the
dominance deviation and homozygous effect sizes are the same for a
large number of loci. In the presence of directional dominance, we
hypothesize that there is a bias in the $Q_x$ statistic: for alleles
displaying directional dominance, systematically dominant alleles in
our target population which have increased in frequency relative to
other populations  will tend to display smaller effect sizes, while
systematically recessive alleles which have recently decreased in
frequency relative to other populations will tend to display larger
effect sizes. In this latter case, false positives for polygenic
selection will occur, because GWAS will systematically choose
recessive alleles that have recently decreased in frequency because of
their larger effect sizes. This is problematic because our test
statistic will then use loci that are
skewed away from the ancestral genetic value. Below is a more mathematical justification for this hypothesis.

Substituting \eqref{eqn:avgeff} into \eqref{eqn:Qxraw}, we can
algebraically derive the following expansion:

\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
  \sum^L_{l=1}( \frac{1}{2}A_l(p_{1l}-\epsilon_l))^2+\sum^L_{l=1}\sum^L_{
    l \neq l'}(\frac{1}{4}A_l(p_{1l}-\epsilon_{l})A_{l'}(p_{1l'}-\epsilon_{l'}))
  \\
  +\sum^L_{l=1}A_lD_l(1-2p_{1l})(p_{1l}-\epsilon_l)^2 +
  \sum^L_{l=1}\sum^L_{l \neq
    l'}(\frac{1}{2}A_lD_{l'}(1-2_{p1l'})(p_{1l}-\epsilon_l)(p_{1l'}-\epsilon_{l'}) \\
  + \frac{1}{2}D_lA_{l'}(1-2_{p1l})(p_{1l}-\epsilon_l)(p_{1l'}-\epsilon_{l'})) \\
   + \sum^L_{l=1} (D_l(1-2p_l)(p_{1l}-\epsilon_{1}))^2
   + \sum^L_{l=1}\sum^L_{l \neq
     l'}D_{l}(1-2p_{l})(p_{1l}-\epsilon_{1})D_{l'}(1-2p_{l'})(p_{1l'}-\epsilon_{l'}) \label{second_exp_ult}
  \end{split}
\end{equation}

Where we can expect much of the bias in the $Qx$ statistic coming from
dominance to come from the last two terms involving $D_l$. Using this
expansion, I have been creating simulations to verify graphically the
effect that dominance has on the test statistic-- I have attached some
of the most important results from these simulations in the pages
below. Figure 1 shows the distribution of the $Q_x$ statistic without dominance as simulated by
the expansion above, which matches a chi-squared distribution with
degree of freedom equal to 1, as expected.

Figures 2, 3, and 4 compare the expected cumulative distribution
function of the $Q_x$ statistic (in red) with the cdf of the simulated
distribution. When the dominance deviation is zero, as expected the
two are nearly identical. However, as dominance deviation increases,
the distribution of the $Q_x$ statistic shifts further and further to
the right. This is further shown in figure 5, which plots the fraction
of the simulated statistics above the value of the statistic expected
for 5\% of the expected distribution, which is chi-squared with 1
df. That is, the plot shows the proportion of $Q_x$ values above the p = 0.05 cutoff value
of the expected chi-squared distribution for different dominance
deviation values. As expected, this plot also
shows that the proportion of simulated $Q_x$ values over the expected
threshold increases as the effect of dominance increases.

Finally, figures 6, 7, and 8 show how dominance affects the genetic
value (that is, the change in allele frequency multiplied by the
effect size $\alpha$) over time. These figures are especially
interesting because they show how specifically directional dominance
can affect genetic value. When the dominance deviation is equal to 0
in figure 6, as expected the genetic values of the replicates drift
randomly over time and the mean line (red) is approximately
zero. However, for positive dominance deviations (fig. 7), the average
genetic value over time becomes negative, while for negative dominance
deviations, the average genetic value over time becomes positive
(compare with the blue line at y=0). This indicates that for positive
dominance the effect of $\alpha$ makes the genetic value for alleles
which are increasing in frequency smaller, and decreasing in frequency
larger, while for negative dominance deviations the effect is the
opposite. This indicates, crucially, that for directionally recessive
traits (like height) which have recently increased in frequency we
expect the effect of multiplying $\alpha$ to increase the perceived
genetic value of the allele, making it more likely to be chosen by GWAS as signifiant and skewing our test statistic $Q_x$.   

So far the work I've been doing this semester has been mainly in
assembling these simulations to directly quantify the statistical bias
in these tests due to dominance. I am currently working on a
simulation that will break down the terms of the expansion to see what
effect each term has separately on the distribution of the
statistic. In addition, I have just gained access to the UK BioBank
data in order to search for the bias within human genetic data.
